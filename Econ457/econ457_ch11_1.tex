    \frametitle{1. Random Walks}
    \framesubtitle{Definition and Formula}

    A \textbf{random walk} is a characterized by the following process:
    $$X_t = X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$$
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $X_t$ = value at time $t$
        \item $X_{t-1}$ = value at previous time period
        \item $\epsilon_t$ = random error term (often called "innovation" or "shock")
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{1em}

    \textbf{Alternative representation:}
    $$\Delta X_t = X_t - X_{t-1} = \epsilon_t$$
    
    In words, the changes in $X$ are purely random and unpredictable.

\end{foundframe}

\begin{foundframe}[t]
    \frametitle{1. Random Walks}
    \framesubtitle{Key Assumptions}

    \textbf{Assumptions about the error term $\epsilon_t$:}
    \vspace{1em}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Zero mean:} $E[\epsilon_t] = 0$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item On average, there is no systematic upward or downward trend
        \end{itemize}
        \vspace{0.5em}

        \item \textbf{Constant variance:} $\text{Var}(\epsilon_t) = \sigma^2$ for all $t$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The magnitude of random fluctuations is constant over time
        \end{itemize}
        \vspace{0.5em}

        \item \textbf{No serial correlation:} $\text{Cov}(\epsilon_t, \epsilon_s) = 0$ for $t \neq s$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Today's shock is independent of past or future shocks
            \item No predictable patterns in the error terms
        \end{itemize}
        \vspace{0.5em}

        \item \textbf{Normal distribution:} $\epsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$ (often assumed)
    \end{enumerate}

\end{foundframe}

\begin{foundframe}[t]
    \frametitle{1. Random Walks}
    \framesubtitle{Expected Behavior and Properties}

    \textbf{Properties of a random walk:}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Expected value:} $E[X_t] = X_0$ (constant over time)
        \item \textbf{Variance grows linearly:} $\text{Var}(X_t) = t \cdot \sigma^2$
        \item \textbf{Standard deviation grows as $\sqrt{t}$:} $\text{SD}(X_t) = \sqrt{t} \cdot \sigma$
        \item \textbf{Unpredictability:} Future values cannot be forecasted better than current value
        \item \textbf{Path dependence:} Current value depends on entire history of shocks
        \item \textbf{Non-stationarity:} Statistical properties change over time
        \item \textbf{Persistence:} Effects of shocks are permanent (no mean reversion)
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{1em}

\end{foundframe}

\begin{foundframe}[t]
    \frametitle{1. Random Walks}
    \framesubtitle{Random Walk with Drift}

    A \textbf{random walk with drift} includes a constant trend component:
    $$X_t = X_{t-1} + \mu + \epsilon_t$$
    where: $\mu$ is drift parameter (constant trend), 
    and $\epsilon_t$ is random error term with $E[\epsilon_t] = 0$
    \vspace{1em}

    \textbf{Properties:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Expected value:} $E[X_t] = X_0 + t \cdot \mu$ (grows linearly)
        \item \textbf{Variance:} $\text{Var}(X_t) = t \cdot \sigma^2$ (same as before)
        \item \textbf{Trend vs. randomness:} Long-run behavior dominated by drift $\mu$
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{1em}

\end{foundframe}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{2. Efficient Markets Hypothesis}
    \framesubtitle{Car Auctions}

    In an auction, the winner will be the bidder with the highest valuation,
     and the winning price will be set by the second highest valuation + a little bit.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A used car is being auctioned.   You value the car at \$18k, your friend 
        values it at \$20k.
        \item Bidding starts at \$15k and moves in \$1k increments.  
        \item You both bid at 15, 16, 17, and 18.
        \item At \$19 you drop out, your friend wins the car for \$19 (less than he values it, btw)
    \end{itemize}
    
    It's tempting to think the analogy for markets is that the investors with the highest valuation will 
    always buy the stock.   Tempting, but wrong...

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{2. Efficient Markets Hypothesis}
    \framesubtitle{Why markets are not like car auctions}

    If markets are complete, traders can short securities.   A security that is over-valued presents 
    a valuable opportunity.   The amount that an investor would be willing to risk on this opportunity 
    is a function of the investor's certainty and the size of the valuation gap.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    In the context of markets, therefore, prices are set by the investor that values the \textit{trade} 
    the highest, and the trade could either be a long or a short trade.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    If the price was always set by the investor with the highest valuation, prices would consistently be 
    set too high (there are a bunch of overly optimistic investors out there).   But, this would be an 
    opportunity for somebody to make money by being short, and therefore can't be an equilibrium.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{2. Efficient Markets Hypothesis}
    \framesubtitle{}

    The \textbf{Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH)} states that
    all available information that could be used to predict 
    stock performance should already be reflected in current stock prices.\\
    \vspace{1em}   
    If true, then future price changes should be 
    unpredictable and stock prices should follow a random walk.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Prices should adjust (automatically) to fair value.  
        \item Fair value reflects both the cost of money 
        (risk-free rate) as well as a risk premium.   
        \item These factors can introduce \textbf{drift} 
        to the series of stock prices.
        \item Prices can and should adjust to \textbf{new} information (earnings, 
        economic data, etc).
    \end{itemize}
    Put more simply: "Prices are right" and "there is no free lunch" (Barberis and Thaler, 2003)

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{2. Efficient Markets Hypothesis}
    \framesubtitle{Three Versions}

    There are three versions of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textit{Weak Form:} Stock prices already reflect all information 
        available from history of past prices, trading volume, and short interest.
        \item \textit{Semistrong Form:} All publicly available information 
        regarding the prospects of the firm is already incorporated in stock prices.
        \item \textit{Strong Form:} Stock prices reflect all relevant information, 
        even if only available to insiders.
    \end{enumerate}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{2. Efficient Markets Hypothesis}
    \framesubtitle{Implications for Active Management}

    Implcations:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Outperforming the competition is only possible if an investor 
    has better information that isn't already reflected in prices.
    Generating better information is costly. 
    The costs are likely to erode some of the excess performance. 
    Trading costs and fees are likely to further reduce net returns.
    \item The change in market prices is unpredictable.   
    It should not be possible to predict price changes using past information. 
    If price changes are unpredictable, the level of prices should behave like a random walk 
    (potentially a random walk with drift)
    \end{enumerate}

    \framesubtitle{Shiller's Defintion of Bubbles}

    In his book \textit{Irrational Exhuberance} Rober Shiller defined a bubble as
    follows:
    
    \vspace{1em}
    
    \begin{quote}
        I define a speculative bubble as a situation in which news of price 
    increases spurs investors enthusiasm, which spreads by pychological contagion 
    from person to person, in the process amplifying stories that might justify 
    the price increases and bringing in a larger and larger class of investors, who, 
    despite doubts about the real value of an investment, are drawn to it partly through 
    envy of others' successes and partly through a gambler's excitement.
    \end{quote}

    \vspace{1em}

    Note all of the words from pyschology: ethusiasm, pychological contagion, envy, and 
    gambler's excitement.\\

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{2. Efficient Markets Hypothesis}
    \framesubtitle{Behavioral Economics}

    There are many findings in behavioral finance that may be relevant for investors,
     including
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Overconfidence
        \item Belief Perserverance
        \item Optimism and Wishful Thinking
        \item Representativeness
        \item Conservatism
        \item Endowment Effects
        \item Anchoring
        \item Availability Bias
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{2. Efficient Markets Hypothesis}
    \framesubtitle{Behavioral Violations}

    Big idea: investors are systematically irrational \textbf{and} there are limits to 
    arbitrage.   As a consequence, markets regularly misprice securities.  
    Examples include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Closed end funds (discounts are correlated across funds, correlated with other 
        asset prices)
        \item Equity carve-outs (pieces don't sum to the whole)
        \item Stocks tend to go up in January and on Mondays
        \item Stocks tend to 'drift' following earnings surprises (prices don't immediately 
       adjust)
        \item Stocks names seem to matter (example: a fund named CUBA held no Cuban assets, but 
        went up when Obama announced a detante with Cuba)
    \end{itemize}

    While these all seem like violations of the efficient market hypothesis, 
    it's not clear how significant or actionable they are.

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{2. Efficient Markets Hypothesis}
    \framesubtitle{Samuelson Dictum and Black's Definition of Efficiency}

    Fisher Black said EMH seemed reasonable if we define "efficient" as follows: 
    individual company stock prices are between half true value and twice 
    true value at least 90\% of the time.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    Paul Samuelson reportedly said that markets are "micro efficient" and 
    "macro inefficient".\\

    \frametitle{3. Momentum}
    \framesubtitle{Definition}

    Momentum refers to the tendency of assets that have risen in price to continue rising, 
    or, conversely, for assets that have fallen in price to keep falling.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    Constructing a momentum factor is straightforward: 
    the difference between the returns on a portfolio of assets that have recently risen 
    minus the returns on a portfolio of assets that have recently fallen.

    \frametitle{4. Mispricing or Risk Premium?}
    \framesubtitle{Outperformance of VALUE strategies}

    Advocates for behavioral finance and efficient markets both agree that 
    value stocks have tended to outperform over time.   They disagree, however, 
    on the reason for the outperformance and the implications.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Behavioral:} Investors \textbf{overreact} to new information.  
        This causes them to over-sell on bad news, and the subsequent price recovery 
        leads to outperformance.   
        \item \textit{Efficient Markets:} The performance of value stocks is highly 
        correlated with systemic risk.   These are riskier companies that could and will 
        fail if there were to be a systemic crisis.   Investor deserve a risk premium for 
        bearing exposure to such companies.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{4. Mispricing or Risk Premium?}
    \framesubtitle{Outperformance of MOMENTUM strategies}

    Similarly, advocates for behavioral finance and efficient markets both agree that 
    momentum strategies have tended to outperform over time.   Again, they disagree, however, 
    on the reason for the outperformance and the implications.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Behavioral:} Investors \textbf{underreact} to new information.  
        They have biases that lead to slow updating.   This causes them to price in 
        information slowly.   
        \item \textit{Efficient Markets:} Investors are often hurt when trends break. 
        By definition, momentum strategies will underporm during these periods.  
        Investors deserve a risk premium for bearing this risk.
