    \frametitle{1. Buybacks}
    \framesubtitle{}

    Recently company managers have preferred to return earnings to shareholders 
    via \textbf{stock buybacks} rather than through dividends.  Buybacks benefit 
    all shareholders through higher prices.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    Advantages of stock buybacks include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Investors treat dividends as 'sticky'.  Any changes to dividend policy
        are scrutinized.   In contrast, stock buybacks are more likely to be considered 
        one-offs, which makes them a good way to distribute excess cash.
        \item Management may view its stock price as undervalued.
        \item There may be different tax treatment between dividends and capital gains
        \item Reduces the amount of equity outstanding, which could improve financial ratios (Earnings per share, Return on Equity)
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{1. Buybacks}
    \framesubtitle{Controversy and Recent Regulation}

    Despite some advantages, stock buybacks are controversial:\\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Prioritizes stock price gains over investments (R\&D, capital expenditures)
        \item Can artificially inflate EPS without improving underlying business performance
        \item Benefits executives with stock-based compensation more than other stakeholders
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{1em}
    Heightened public awareness led to some recent changes in tax and regulatory treatment:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Inflation Reduction Act (2022): 1\% excise tax on share repurchases by public companies
        \item SEC enhanced disclosure requirements (2023): more detailed reporting on buyback timing and rationale
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{2. Free Cash Flow Models}
    \framesubtitle{Modigliani and Miller}

    The Modigliani-Miller theorem states that in perfect capital markets, 
    a firm's value is independent of its capital structure (debt vs. equity mix).
     The formal proof relies on some key assumptons, including, for example,
     no taxes, no bankruptcy costs, perfect information and efficient markets.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    For the intuition, note that debt is usually cheaper than equity.  A more 
    leveraged firm will have more debt, which will seemingly reduce its cost of financing.
     However, the more leveraged firm is also riskier, so the interest rate on that debt and the 
     required return on equity will both rise, and, in the model, perfectly offsetting the initial benefit.   
     Therefore the weighted average cost of capital is unchanged, even as the mix of debt and equity changes.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{2. Free Cash Flow Models}
    \framesubtitle{Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)}

    \textbf{Definition:} Cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity holders) before any financing costs.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    \textbf{Calculation:}
    \begin{align*}
    FCFF &= \text{EBIT}(1-\text{Tax Rate}) + \text{Depreciation} \\
         &\quad - \text{Capital Expenditures} - \text{Change in Working Capital}
    \end{align*}
    \vspace{1em}
    \textbf{Valuation:}
    $$\text{Firm Value} = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{FCFF_t}{(1 + WACC)^t}$$
    Where $WACC$ is the weighted average cost of capital\\
    \vspace{1em}
    \textbf{Use Case:} Total firm valuation; subtract debt to get equity value

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{2. Free Cash Flow Models}
    \framesubtitle{Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)}

    \textbf{Definition:} Cash flow available to equity holders after all expenses, taxes, debt payments, and reinvestment needs.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    \textbf{Calculation:}
    \begin{align*}
    FCFE &= FCFF - \text{Interest Expense}(1-\text{Tax Rate}) + \text{Increases in net debt}
    \end{align*}
    \vspace{1em}
    \textbf{Valuation:}
    $$\text{Equity Value} = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{FCFE_t}{(1 + r_E)^t}$$
    Where $r_E$ is the required return on equity (cost of equity)\\
    \vspace{1em}
    \textbf{Use Case:} Direct valuation of equity, particularly useful for leveraged firms

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{2. Free Cash Flow Models}
    \framesubtitle{Modigliani and Miller}

    Implication of Modigliani and Miller Theorem for Valuation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Firm value depends only on underlying cash flows, not financing decisions
        \item Focus valuation on operating performance rather than capital structure
        \item Provides foundation for free cash flow valuation methods
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{1em}
    Note that in practice, when valuing the same firm using FCFF (discounted at WACC) 
    versus FCFE (discounted at cost of equity), the implied equity values are rarely 
    equal. This suggests that Modigliani Miller assumptions don't hold perfectly in 
    practice - not surprising given the restrictive assumptions.

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{3. Relative Valuation}
    \framesubtitle{}

    The dividend discount model valued a company based on its earnings and a discount rate.  
    Using the modeled valuation, an investor could then determine whether the market price was 
    too high or too low, and either sell or buy accordingly.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    An alternative approach would be to compare the market price of a company to the price of 
    either other, similar companies OR compared to the price of that company over time.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    This approach requires \textit{normalizing} the market price by something, in order to account 
    for observable differences across comparison companies.   A common approach is to normalize 
    the price by \textbf{earnings}, although there are other possibilities too.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{3. Relative Valuation}
    \framesubtitle{P/E Ratio}

    Reminder that the value of a perpetuity is given by:
    $$P_0 = \frac{c}{k}$$
    Where $P_0$ is the current price, $c$ is the payment amount, and $k$ is the discount rate.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    The value of a company that has no expected growth is similar to a perpetuity, with the 
    payment amount equal to earnings ($E$).\\
    $$P_0 = \frac{E}{k}$$
    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{3. Relative Valuation}
    \framesubtitle{P/E Ratio}

    Still thinking about companies with no expected growth (i.e. perpetuities), 
    the Price-Earnings Ratio is:
    $$P_0/E = \frac{1}{k}$$
    Because the earnings cancels out.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    For illustrative purposes, assume that $k=12.5\%$.   
    Then the P-E Ratio would be $1/0.125 = 8$.
    \vspace{1em}

    In words: investors should be willing to pay \$8 billion for a company with a 
    required return of 12.5\%, no-growth prospects, and earnings next year of \$1 billion.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{3. Relative Valuation}
    \framesubtitle{P/E Ratio}

    Of course, companies also have growth prospects, which should increase their value.  
    We can define the value of a company as follows:
    \begin{align*}
    P_0 &= \text{PV(no-growth)} + \text{PV(Growth Opportunities)}\\
        &= \frac{E_1}{k} + PVGO
    \end{align*}
    Where $PVGO$ is $PV(Growth Opportunities)$\\

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{3. Relative Valuation}
    \framesubtitle{P/E Ratio}

    Dividing this by $E_1$ and doing a little rearranging 
    gives an expression for the P/E Ratio:
    $$
    \frac{P_0}{E_1} = \frac{1}{k} \left(1 + \frac{PVGO}{E/k}\right)
    $$
    The term $\frac{PVGO}{E/k}$ is the ratio of the growth opportunities 
    to the no-growth scenario for the firm.  And the term $\frac{1}{k}$ is 
    what we say earlier about the PE ratio for a no-growth firm.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    In words, the PE ratio is the value of a perpetuity multiplied by 
    one plus the ratio of PVGO to the no-growth value.  Firms will higher 
    PVGOs will have higher PE ratios.   Investors are willing to pay more 
    for companies with better growth prospects.

    \frametitle{3. Relative Valuation}
    \framesubtitle{P/E Ratio - Earnings}

    In order to estimate the P-E Ratio you need to know the earnings.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    Ideally, you would have an estimate for forward earnings.  This could come from 
    company guidance, or analyst consensus, or your own analysis.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    An often used substitute is earnings over the trailing twelve months (ttm).  While not ideal,
     this is easily observed and readily available.

    Define the Cyclically Adjusted P-E Ratio (CAPE) as the "stock price divided by 
    average real earnings over the previous 10 year."\\

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Adjusted for inflation (real earnings)
        \item 10 years is long enough to smooth over business cycles
    \end{itemize}

    Accordingly, we would expect the CAPE to smoother than the PE ratio.

    The inverse of the PE is the \textit{earnings yield}: $E/P$.\\
    \vspace{1em} 
    Define the \textit{excess CAPE yield} as 
    $$\frac{1}{CAPE} - (\text{10y real UST yield})$$
    \vspace{1em}
    Is this a good measure of value?   When CAPE is high (low), the excess CAPE yield is 
    low (high) and suggests future returns will also be low (high).\\
