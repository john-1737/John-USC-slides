    \blfootnote{The Markwotiz model determines optimal weights $w_i$, given 
    $\mathbb{E}[r_i]$, $r_i$, and $\sigma_i$, for securities $i=1...n$.   Markowitz says nothing about
     what the security prices \textit{should} be.   That is where CAPM comes in.}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{1. The Market Portfolio and Equilibrium}
    \framesubtitle{CAPM assumptions}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Investors are similar
        \begin{itemize} 
            \item Investors are mean-variance optimizers
            \item Investors have the same expectations for asset characteristics (means, variances, correlations)
            \item Investors have the same time horizons
        \end{itemize}
    \item Markets are complete
        \begin{itemize} 
            \item No taxes
            \item No trading costs
            \item Unlimited leverage available at the risk-free rate
            (and therefore short positions allowed)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    These may seem overly restrictive.   Some can be relaxed and CAPM still holds.  
    More importantly, CAPM is, like all models, a useful simplification.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{1. The Market Portfolio and Equilibrium}
    \framesubtitle{Equilibrium}

    Under these assumptions, we can conclude that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The market portfolio is optimal.   No portfolio exists with better reward-to-risk.
        \item The market portfolio is an equilibrum.   
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{1em}

    The \textbf{expected return of the market} is determined by economic factors 
    (wealth, average risk aversion, risk-free rate).\\
    \vspace{1em}

    Moreover, if the market portfolio is an equilibrium, this has strong implications for 
    \textbf{expected return of individual securities}, which is the next part of the lecture.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{1. The Market Portfolio and Equilibrium}
    \framesubtitle{Market Price of Risk}

    Define the \textbf{market price of risk} as the reward-to-risk for investment in the market portfolio:

    $$\frac{\text{Market Risk Premium}}{\text{Market Variance}} = \frac{\mathbb{E}[R_m]}{\sigma_m^2}$$
    Where $\mathbb{E}[R_m] = \mathbb{E}[r_m] - r_f$ is the risk premium and $\sigma_m^2$ is the variance 
    of the market portfolio.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    Notice that this is \textit{not} the same as the Sharpe Ratio, which has the standard deviation in the denominator.  
    Using variance instead makes the math cleaner when we consider the contribution of a single security to a portfolio risk.\\
    \vspace{1em} 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{1. The Market Portfolio and Equilibrium}
    \framesubtitle{Contribution of a single security to market risk}

    The contribution of a security $xyz$ to the variance of the market portfolio is given by:
    $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i Cov(R_{xyz},R_i)$$
    for all $i$ in the market portfolio.  
    Using standard rules of variances and covariances, this can be rewritten as:
    $$w_{xyz}Cov(R_{xyz},R_m)$$
    where $R_m$ is the return of the market portfolio.  
    In words, the contribution of security $xyz$ to the variance 
    of the market portfolio is 
    the Covariance of $xyz$ with the market portfolio (multiplied by the weight, $w_{xyz}$).

    \framesubtitle{Equilibrium Condition for Expected Returns}

    From Bodi et al, p 119:
    \vspace{1em}

    \begin{quote}
    A basic principal of equilibrium is that all investments should offer the same reward-to-risk ratio.
    If the ratio were better for one investment than another, investors would rearrange their portfolios.
    This would cause prices to adjust until the expected reward-to-risk were equal.
    \textbf{Therefore, we conclude that the reward-to-risk for each security is equal to the reward-to-risk for the market portfolio.}
    \end{quote}

    This provides a nice equilibrium condition that can 
    be used to determine the expected returns of a security.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{2. Implications of CAPM Equilibrium}
    \framesubtitle{Equilibrium Condition for Expected Returns}


    The equilibrium condition says that overweighting stock $xyz$ relative to the market portfolio should neither improve or detract the reward-to-risk, therefore we it must be the case that:\\

    $$\frac{\mathbb{E}[R_{xyz}]}{Cov(R_{xyz},R_m)} = \frac{\mathbb{E}[R_m]}{\sigma_m^2}$$
    
    \vspace{1em}
    The denominator on left hand side is the contribution of $xzy$ to the 
    risk of the market portfolio.   
    The right hand side of the equation is the reward-to-risk for the entire market.\\

    ...Continued.   Rearranging:
    $$\mathbb{E}[R_{xyz}] = \frac{Cov(R_{xyz},R_m)}{\sigma_m^2}\mathbb{E}[R_m]$$
    \vspace{1em} 

    The first term on the right hand side is the contribution of $xyz$ to 
    variance of the market portfolio, 
    as a share of the total variance of the market portfolio.\\
    \vspace{1em}
    This term is often referred to as $\beta_{xyz}$.

    \framesubtitle{Equilibrium Condition for Expected Returns}

    Define the Beta of a security as as:
    $$\beta_{xyz} = \frac{Cov(R_{xyz},R_m)}{\sigma_m^2}$$
    Beta has two valid interpretations:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The risk each dollar invested in security $xyz$ contributes to the risk of the market portfolio.
        \item The regression coefficient for $R_{xyz}$ on $R_m$, or the sensitivity of the 
        excess returns of security $xyz$ to variation in the market excess returns.
    \end{enumerate}

    \framesubtitle{Prices Adjust}

    Draw the Security Market Line using the following considerations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If a security is uncorrelated with the market, then overweighting that 
        security will reduce the variance of the resulting portfolio.   
        The return on this security must be equal to the risk-free return, 
        otherwise it would be possible to construct a better portfolio than the market, 
        thereby violating the equilibrium condition.
        \item If a security is perfectly correlated with the market and had a better 
        expected return than the market portfolio, then that would also violate the 
        equilibrium assumption.   Conclude the return on a security with $\beta=1$ must 
        be the same as the market portfolio
        \item The excess return for a security with $\beta \neq 1$ is given 
        by the equilibrium condition to be $\beta \mathbb{E}[R_M]$
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textit{All securities must lie on the Security Market Line (SML)!}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{2. Implications of CAPM Equilibrium}

    What if a security lies off the SML?

\begin{frame}[t]

    What is the reward-to-risk of overweighting security $xyz$ in the market portfolio?
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \text{Reward:} &\quad \mathbb{E}[R_{xyz}] = \alpha_{xyz} + \beta \cdot \mathbb{E}[R_m] \\
    \text{Risk:} &\quad Cov(R_{xyz},R_m) 
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Note that the risk is the Covariance with the market portfolio.   
    The risk is NOT the variance of $r_{xyz}$.   
    This is a key component of the CAPM assumptions.   
    The market portfolio is optimal, investors hold that already, 
    everything else is compared to holding the market portfolio.

    ...Continued As above, let $\beta = \frac{Cov(R_{xyz},R_m)}{\sigma_m^2}$

    \begin{align*}
    \left(\frac{\text{reward}}{\text{risk}}\right)_{xyz}   &= \frac{\mathbb{E}[\alpha_{xyz}] + \beta \cdot \mathbb{E}[R_m]}{Cov(R_{xyz},R_m)}\\

    Therefore, if $\alpha_{xyz} < 0$, then adding $xyz$ will decrease the reward-to-risk of an investor's portfolio.   Continued...

    But, prices adjust! \\
    \vspace{1em}
    If $\alpha_{xyz} < 0$ in expectation, then investors will sell $xyz$.   
    Selling $xyz$ lowers the price (raises the expected return).   
    This will happen until $\alpha_{xyz} = 0$ in expectation.\\

    \frametitle{3. A Linear Model}
    \framesubtitle{}

    The equilibrium condition for CAPM, with a bit of rearranging, gives the following 
    expression for expected excess returns of security $xyz$:
    $$\mathbb{E}[R_{xyz}] = \frac{Cov(R_{xyz},R_m)}{\sigma_m^2}\mathbb{E}[R_m]$$

    Substituting $\beta_{xyz} = \frac{Cov(R_{xyz},R_m)}{\sigma_m^2}$ 
    and $\mathbb{E}[R_m] = \mathbb{E}[r_m] - r_f$, gives the standard 
    formulation of CAPM for expected returns of security $xyz$:\\
    $$\boxed{\mathbb{E}[r_{xyz}] = r_f + \beta_{xyz}(\mathbb{E}[r_m] - r_f)}$$\\
    \vspace{1em} 



\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]

    $$\boxed{\mathbb{E}[r_{xyz}] = r_f + \beta_{xyz}(\mathbb{E}[r_m] - r_f)}$$
    \vspace{1em}

    This expression gives the expected return of stock $xyz$ as a function of the following:\\
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Risk-free rate ($r_f$)
        \item Expected excess market return ($\mathbb{E}[R_m] = \mathbb{E}[r_m] - r_f$)
        \item $\beta_{xyz}$
